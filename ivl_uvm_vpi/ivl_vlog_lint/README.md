# VPI based Verilog Lint checker in Icarus Verilog

This tiny example contains a VPI/PLI based app for checking basic naming conventions in Verilog design. 

Code and idea is heavily borrowed from Guru's VPI example found at Project Veripage: https://project-veripage.com/vpilint.php

As part of IVL_UVM, we fixed few gcc warnings and simplified to compile with Icarus supported VPI constructs.

## TBD
  Original example has 3 lint check examples, as of now only one is supported in Icarus.
